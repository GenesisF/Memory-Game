# Memory-Game
Memory card game
This is a Memory Card Game, with 12 cards suffle as you re-play de game, you will be rate as you make movements to found
the pair of each card in total would be a 6 pair of cards.

I made the html and css frames by scratch using css styling an flex-box
For the Java Script file I implement ES6 syntax, I declare my variables in the global object so then i can use those later
as I movove forward with the functionality of my game, during the process also I lerned about the importance to place in the
right the fucntion and then call them.

The memory game also will tell you how many moves do you make the time that took you to find all the matches and also
you can re set the game to play again.

Hope you have fun!!!
